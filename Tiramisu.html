        <b>Tiramisu</b>  is a timeless no-bake Italian dessert combining espresso-dipped ladyfingers and a creamy lightly sweetened mascarpone cream.
        This recipe is from the late Maida Heatterand is easily the best homemade tiramisu recipe that 
        I've ever tried  
        <br></br>
        A couple months ago,I was sent a new cookbook called Happiness is Baking. This cookbook inculdes Maida Heatter's 
        favorite recipe with the foreword written by Dorie Greenspan. I, unsurprisingly,immediately fell in love with my newest 
        cookbook .It's a collection of 100  foolproof annd classic desserts including cookies, cakes, muffins,pies,tarts
        ,and more that range from simple everyday cookies to outrageosly indulgent choclate souffle cake.

             career included 9 cookbooks,recipes for the Times , a restaurant, and three  James Beard Awards. Baker and author Dorie Greenspan
             once said ''Whenever someone tells me they want to learn to bake, I tell them to start with Maida Heatter's books.That's what i did.''

        <h3>Common Tiramisu Questions-Answered</h3> 
        <br><br>
        <dl> 
            <b>What kind of rum do I use in tiramisu?</b> 
            <dd>Dark rum is best,but you can use brandy or your favorite coffee liqueur </dd>
             <br><br>
            <b>Egg whites or whipped cream?</b> 
            <dd>Most Tiramisu  recipes use whipped egg whites OR whipped cream in the mascarpone
                cream layers.Egg whites contribute a more airy texture,while whipped cream makes the filling a bit  more rich.
                This recipe actually uses both , so you're getting both delightful textures. </dd>
                <br><br>
                <b>Are the  eggs cooked?</b> 
                <dd>Tiramisu is no-bake  dessert. The egg yolks are gently cooked on the stovetop, but the egg whites are raw.
                    Purchase pastuerized eggs because they are safe to consume raw. </dd>
                    <br><br> 
                    <b>What size pan to use?</b>
                    <dd>This particular Tiramisu recipe yields a large volume and the pan will  be very full. Make sure your pan
                        is large enough. I recommend a 9x13 inch dish with at least a 12-14 cup capacity.This 4 quart dish is wonderful too.
